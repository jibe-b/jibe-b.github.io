## Model, theory, statement
2015-29-01, Jibé

The relationships between a model, a theory and a statement are defined basically as:

- model and theory are theoretical frames,
- that have specific relationships to statements (hypothesis, observation, prediction)

Statements are instances of the Statement class (that is very general). Described Classes may be written in the future, specifying the Statements (using the relationships that are made).
