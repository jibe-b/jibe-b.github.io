## Intention#1: Five main classes

- __Object__ and __Phenomenon__ correspond of the _description_ of the physical world, requiring a low-level of abstraction. Both take part to a kind of _zoology_ in Physical Sciences.
- __Quantity__ and __Law__ enable an approach with a high level of abstraction. __Quantity__ require instrumentation and __Law__ require theory to be accessible.
- sub-properties of __Property__  caracterise __Object__ (__ObjectProperty__), __Phenomenon__(__PhenomenonProperty__), __Quantity__ (__QuantityProperty__) and __Law__ (__LawProperty__).
