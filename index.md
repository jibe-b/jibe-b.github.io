Here is a kind of scientific blog
=================================

What can be found here
----------------------

Here you will find the projects I am taking part to, the Open Lab
Notebook I keep in conducting projects
<!-- (and futurely doing research)-->, and as a blog as well.

Both English and French languages are used. If you can't read one
article because of this, feel free to ask me to translate, that wouldn't
be a problem.

Projects
--------

-   [Physical Sciences
    ontology](projects/presentation-projet-ontologie.html) (status:
    under development)

Open Science
------------

All the work you will find here aims to be fully documented, with record
kept about each step and choice. All publications are made under a
creative commons licence that requires you to cite me as author of the
original version and then to do whatever you want, especially great
things.
