<h1 id="protocol">Protocol</h1>

<h2 id="myprinciples">My principles</h2>

<ul>
<li>I aim to produce knowledge — valid in the indicated intervals</li>
<li>my work aims to be reproducible</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ourrelation">Our relation</h2>

<ul>
<li>what I produce is a Common, accessible and under a free licence</li>
<li>I invite you to judge by yourself the rigor of the statements and the reproducibility of the work</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mypersonalmotivations">My personal motivations</h2>

<ul>
<li>as a person, I want to make knowledge available to humankind</li>
<li>provide ways to see things from a different point of view</li>
<li>give a place to all opinions as long as debate rules are respected</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cooperation">Cooperation</h2>

<ul>
<li>even though one should manage to achieve basics goals with success alone, I believe that great things can only be achieved through sharing</li>
<li>cooperation can be achieved through sharing of energy, ideas, synchronisation of action and debate</li>
<li>coooperation is also an end in itself, enabling ideas to be living, intereacting, possibly merging or transformed to more complex ideas</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="concretely">Concretely</h1>

<h2 id="undercertaindelaywecancollaborate">Under certain delay, we can collaborate</h2>

<ul>
<li>interaction, discussion takes no time, write me an email whenever you have the time to do so or come to my office on Friday (open Büro)</li>
<li>discussion, debate, synchronisation takes some time, so contact me early, and let us maturate the idea together</li>
<li>action may be short or long, as long as we respect this protocol, we should manage to do something together</li>
</ul>
