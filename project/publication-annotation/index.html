<h1 class="title">Annotation of scientific publications</h1>
</div>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>
<p>Scientific discoveries, literature reviews and discussion on hot topics go through a process of publication that helps normalize the scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>One can observe that the web technologies enable to go further than plain-text publishing. At least, one can consider that current pdf publications can be amplified. At this point, there are tool-related choices to be made.</p>
<p>My experience on the use of Linked Data (RDF graphs and web ontologies) makes me think that plain-text articles can be associated with RDF graphs containing the same information as contained in the article, but using a semantic technologies that strengthen discoverability and data interoperability. In the case you don't know much about Linked Data and RDF, please have a look at <a href="http://www.cambridgesemantics.com/semantic-university/introduction-linked-data-0">this tutorial</a> or look for yours on the web.</p>
<h3 id="concretely">Concretely</h3>
<p>Already published articles (mainly the open access ones available in open archives) may be annotated using the user-friendly markup syntax called SemanticMarkdown, that I develop. Other languages may do the job as well, but this syntax is developped on purpose and may be improved while using it.</p>
<p>A graph must contain the same information as the publication. Both the graph and the metadata of the article are stored in a triplestore (graph database).</p>
<p>These databases can be queried with SPARQL queries that enable semantic querying and reasoning on the data. Hence, information can be obtained from the data, starting with possible contradictions between the uploaded graphs, to rich deductions. Learning the basics of this query language requires little time (2 hours for people with basic programming skills). Complex queries can be written too.</p>
<p>Review of the graphs can be done through discussion of SPARQL queries results. Hence reviwer-author exchanges can be carried on, so that the uploaded graphs be improved.</p>
<p>At the stage of the project when enough data and activity are present, there should be a discussion on the state of the project and improvements of the features and processes in order to match the reality of the data.</p>

<h2 id="participate">Participate</h2>
<p>Whatever comes to your mind when reading this project description, I encourage you warmly to contact me via <a href="https://twitter.com/jibe_jeybee">twitter</a>. Authors of a publication archived in an open access archive (ArXiV, HAL, etc) have the perfect profile!</p>
<p>May you think that learning about Linked Data and the associated query language SPARQL, I will do my best to guide you (would a selection of the existingg tutorials associated to the question they help solving fit your expectations? <a href="https://twitter.com/jibe_jeybee">Tell me!</a></p>
<p>Anyhow, this project will look like what who participate make it look like…</p>
