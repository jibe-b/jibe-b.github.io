<p>#Introduction</p>
<p>SMd is an extension on the Markdown syntax that enables to embbed markup needed to couple linear writing and RDF triples.</p>
<p>The RDF triples embedded in a SMd file can be extracted as well as the linear text can be used by a tool like <a href="">Pandoc</a> to produce a html or pdf file.</p>
<p>In terms of user experience, SMd enables to write linearly and extract the graph that is stored inside the text, capturing the non-linearity inherent to any speech.</p>
<p>Another possible use is the annotation of existing linear text as Markdown is fully compatible with SMd.</p>
<p>##Licence
The SMd syntax is CC-BY-SA and credits the authors of Markdown, RDF and SPARQL and all software dependencies are used with respect to the respective licences.</p>
<p>##Developerâ€™s note</p>
<p>This extension of the Markdown syntax was guided by both wide theoretical questions (how to couple the writing of linear texts and non-linear graphs) and personal issus (how to implement this using tools and syntaxe I was already familiar with), hence the choice of a specific syntax (Markdown), an implementation of a SMd to turtle and Md converter and specific issues or bugs that remain at the current stage of development. Therefore, this project should still be considered as technically immature and will surely benefit from any participation.</p>
