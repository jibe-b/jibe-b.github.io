<p>Another way of writing.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>The future (at least the close future) of data storing and data use are Linked Data. May you be convinced or not, it could be right.</p>
<p>Still today, we do write, store and use what we write, but Linked Data is rarely present.</p>
<h2 id="main-idea">Main idea</h2>
<p>Why not writing documents that contain Linked Data right into them, without the difficult step of coding RDF/XML triples?</p>
<p>Writing in Markdown using semantic markups makes it possible to embed usable triples right into any text.</p>
<p>And as RDF has by essence a graph structure, it is possible to create graphs that are stored in semantic markdown and/or in RDF/XML and/or in JSON.</p>
<p>Storing both text and graph in the same format would enable to synchronise what is produced in both formats. And to write using both methods: graph edition and text edition.</p>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>make semantic markdown convertible to html+RDFa</li>
<li>create an app for editing graphs</li>
<li>make the synchronisation between text and graph editing clean, i.e.
<ul>
<li>make semantic markdown and the graph format compatible</li>
<li>store text and graph in a clean way</li>
<li>avoid graph editing from making it totally dirty and absolutely not user-friendly.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
